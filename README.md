# Wesleiter Upright 123
This is a piano sound library (Wesleiter Upright 123) sampled with Kontakt at my house in Xiangyang, Hubei, China (2013).<br>
This file is compressed with .zipx format.<br>
The demo followed shows the sound of this Kontakt sound library, the demo.mp3 is the build in effect, and demo**.mp3 is tuned outside the kontakt and it sounds more realistic than the real piano at my home when I am playing.
